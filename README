NOTE: At the moment, these are IDEAS. There is nothing programmed yet.

"Invisible Doors" is a Minecraft BukkitCraft Server Plugin that enables the player to make regular blocks walk-through,
but only for the people who the creator allows permission (creator automatically included but can be removed)

Possible commands:
/invdoor tool (gives the "wand")
/invdoor create (creates the pass-through blocks within the selected area)
/invdoor delete (removes a door)
/invdoor add (adds a person to the list of "passers")
/invdoor remove (removes a person from the list of "passers")

Permission Nodes:
invdoor.create (allows the creation of doors)
invdoor.remove (allows the removal of a door owned by the remover)
invdoor.remove.all (allows the removal of all doors)
